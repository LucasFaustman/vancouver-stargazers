## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

My second attempt at making a web app using existing API's. Built with the NASAP API integration to give users the APOD with a brief description. You can also get historical APOD's.

## Optimizations

I would further continue to optimize the layout on mobile. The mobile layout isn't perfect, but the fact that the API can sometimes be an image or video through me off with positioning.

I would also create 2 event listeners, one for the get todays APOD button and another for historical APOD's.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to continiously go through the Chrome developer tools to check in to see how my layout is looking on mobile, instead of building for desktops first.
